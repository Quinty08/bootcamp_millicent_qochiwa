Stage 11 â€” Evaluation & Risk Communication

Key findings:
- Best-performing scenario (based on MAE/RMSE): {'MAE': 108.55737700409139, 'RMSE': 314.12961761128497, 'R2': 0.9717122337011855}
- Linear model is more interpretable but RandomForest gives better predictive performance (lower MAE/RMSE).
- Bootstrap 95% CI for MAE (linear mean): (np.float64(162.71166470387166), np.float64(182.82618622311244))
- Bootstrap 95% CI for MAE (rf mean): (np.float64(99.67695349525603), np.float64(118.3916308677518))

Subgroup analysis (by Region):

Assumptions:
- Missing values handled by mean or median imputation in scenarios; results sensitive to imputation strategy.
- Preprocessing dropped identifier-like columns and encoded categorical variables.

Risks:
- Model may be biased for small subgroups (see subgroup diagnostics).
- Capping/trimming/outliers treatment impacts tail predictions.
- For production, monitor model drift, prediction distributions, and subgroup performance.

Recommended next steps:
1. Run subgroup fairness checks and confusion/risk thresholds (if converting to classification).
2. Conduct stress tests for extreme inputs (large loan amounts, very low salary).
3. Add monitoring for AFFORDABILITY prediction distribution and retrain schedule.
