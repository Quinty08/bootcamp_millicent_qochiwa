\# Corporate Loan Credit Scoring Project



\*\*Stage:\*\* Problem Framing \& Scoping (Stage 01)



\## Problem Statement

Commercial banks face challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of corporate borrowers, especially mid-sized firms without extensive credit histories. Current methods rely heavily on financial ratios and manual assessments, which are time-consuming and may overlook important predictive signals. A more systematic, data-driven approach is needed to reduce default risk and improve loan portfolio quality.



\## Stakeholder \& User

The primary stakeholder is the bank’s credit risk team (decision-makers), while the main users are credit analysts and loan officers who review applications and approve/reject loans. Their workflow requires timely, reliable scoring models that fit into existing risk review processes.



\## Useful Answer \& Decision

The project should deliver a \*\*predictive model\*\* that estimates the probability of default (PD) for corporate loans. The useful artifact is a scoring system or risk ranking metric that enables the bank to decide whether to approve, reject, or price a loan appropriately.



\## Assumptions \& Constraints

\- Assumes access to historical corporate loan data (features: affordability, payment history, industry info).

\- Must handle missing or incomplete borrower data.

\- Models need to be interpretable for regulators and credit committees.

\- Deployment must work within latency limits of loan review process.



\## Known Unknowns / Risks

\- Data quality issues (incomplete financial reporting).

\- Changing macroeconomic conditions affecting default risk.

\- Regulatory requirements for transparency in credit models.

\- Model drift over time as borrower behavior changes.



\## Lifecycle Mapping

| Goal | Stage | Deliverable |

|------|-------|-------------|

| Frame credit scoring problem | Problem Framing \& Scoping (Stage 01) | Scoping paragraph + repo setup |

| Build baseline predictive model | Modeling \& Evaluation (Stage 02) | Prototype notebook |

| Validate and interpret results | Evaluation \& Stress Testing (Stage 03) | Validation memo |

\## Repo Plan

Folders: `/data/`, `/src/`, `/notebooks/`, `/docs/`


## Stage 02 — Tooling Setup

**Objective:**  
Establish a reproducible project environment, prepare folder structure, and ensure version control for all future stages.

**Folder Structure:**  
The project is organized for maintainability and clarity:


**Key Setup Items:**  
- `.gitignore` added to exclude temporary, OS, and sensitive files.  
- `requirements.txt` added to capture the Python environment (`bootcamp_env`) for reproducibility.  
- Initial scaffolding for `/data/`, `/docs/`, `/notebooks/`, `/src/`, and `/tests/` prepared.
