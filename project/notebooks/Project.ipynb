    "\n",
    "Commercial banks face challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of corporate borrowers, especially mid-sized firms without extensive credit histories. Current methods rely heavily on financial ratios and manual assessments, which are time-consuming and may overlook important predictive signals. A more systematic, data-driven approach is needed to reduce default risk and improve loan portfolio quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "**\\## Stakeholder \\& User**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary stakeholder is the bankâ€™s credit risk team (decision-makers), while the main users are credit analysts and loan officers who review applications and approve/reject loans. Their workflow requires timely, reliable scoring models that fit into existing risk review processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\## Useful Answer \\& Decision**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project should deliver a \\*\\*predictive model\\*\\* that estimates the probability of default (PD) for corporate loans. The useful artifact is a scoring system or risk ranking metric that enables the bank to decide whether to approve, reject, or price a loan appropriately.\n",
