\# Corporate Loan Credit Scoring Project

\*\*Stage:\*\* Problem Framing \& Scoping (Stage 01)



\## Problem Statement

Commercial banks face challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of corporate borrowers, especially mid-sized firms without extensive credit histories. Current methods rely heavily on financial ratios and manual assessments, which are time-consuming and may overlook important predictive signals. A more systematic, data-driven approach is needed to reduce default risk and improve loan portfolio quality.



\## Stakeholder \& User

The primary stakeholder is the bank’s credit risk team (decision-makers), while the main users are credit analysts and loan officers who review applications and approve/reject loans. Their workflow requires timely, reliable scoring models that fit into existing risk review processes.



\## Useful Answer \& Decision

The project should deliver a \*\*predictive model\*\* that estimates the probability of default (PD) for corporate loans. The useful artifact is a scoring system or risk ranking metric that enables the bank to decide whether to approve, reject, or price a loan appropriately.



\## Assumptions \& Constraints

\- Assumes access to historical corporate loan data (features: financial ratios, payment history, industry info).

\- Must handle missing or incomplete borrower data.

\- Models need to be interpretable for regulators and credit committees.

\- Deployment must work within latency limits of loan review process.



\## Known Unknowns / Risks

\- Data quality issues (incomplete financial reporting).

\- Changing macroeconomic conditions affecting default risk.

\- Regulatory requirements for transparency in credit models.

\- Model drift over time as borrower behavior changes.



\## Lifecycle Mapping

Goal → Stage → Deliverable

\- Frame credit scoring problem → Problem Framing \& Scoping (Stage 01) → Scoping paragraph + repo setup

\- Build baseline predictive model → Modeling \& Evaluation (Stage 02) → Prototype notebook

\- Validate and interpret results → Evaluation \& Stress Testing (Stage 03) → Validation memo

\- Deliver stakeholder-facing tool → Deployment \& Handoff (Stage 04) → Risk scoring artifact



\## Repo Plan

Folders: `/data/`, `/src/`, `/notebooks/`, `/docs/`  

README updated each stage; commits weekly or at each milestone.
