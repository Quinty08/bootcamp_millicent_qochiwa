\# Stakeholder Memo â€” Corporate Loan Credit Scoring Project



\## Purpose

This memo summarizes the problem, objectives, and expected outcomes for the corporate loan credit scoring project. It is intended for the bank's credit risk team and loan officers.



\## Problem

Commercial banks face challenges assessing the creditworthiness of mid-sized corporate borrowers. Current methods rely heavily on financial ratios and manual assessments, which are slow and may miss predictive signals. A data-driven scoring model is needed to improve accuracy, reduce default risk, and speed up loan decisions.



\## Stakeholders \& Users

\- \*\*Decision-makers:\*\* Credit Risk Team  

\- \*\*Users:\*\* Credit Analysts and Loan Officers



\## Goals

\- Deliver a predictive model estimating probability of default (PD) for corporate loans.

\- Provide a scoring system or ranking metric to guide loan approval, rejection, or pricing decisions.

\- Ensure model is interpretable for regulators and fits within loan review workflow.



\## Assumptions \& Constraints

\- Historical loan data is available (financial ratios, payment history, industry info).  

\- Model must handle missing/incomplete data.  

\- Latency and interpretability requirements must be met.



\## Known Unknowns / Risks

\- Data quality and completeness  

\- Macroeconomic changes affecting default risk  

\- Regulatory compliance requirements  

\- Model drift over time
