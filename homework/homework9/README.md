Homework 9 — Feature Engineering



In this stage, I created two new engineered features based on the my dataset:



Credit Utilization Proxy (credit\_utilization\_proxy)



Definition: Monthly Spend ÷ Credit Score



Rationale: Provides a proxy for how much a customer spends relative to their credit capacity. Higher ratios may indicate higher financial stress or potential default risk.



Income vs. Regional Mean (income\_vs\_region\_mean)



Definition: Income − Average Income of Customer’s Region



Rationale: Captures how an individual’s income compares to their peers in the same region. Useful for detecting relative wealth levels and spending potential.



Both features were added to the dataset and plotted for distribution/relationship.
